Compatibility changes
---------------------
changed <> to !=
changed print statements to include parenthesis
installed pyserial to import serial
changed time.clock() to time.process_time()
modified write statements to encode unicode strings with .encode('utf-8')



RS-232 Communication
--------------------
Communication protocol: 4 consecutive bytes are sent in either direction
    before a response (again 4 bytes) is required


Transmitting
------------
Byte 0: Bits 31-28 contain the checksum to detect errors
        Bit 27 is the LstRsp bit for communication errors
        Bits 25-24 are empty
        Bit 24 indicates read (0) or write (1)
Byte 1: Target register (0x00-0xff)
Byte 2: Data (15:8) (0x00-0xff)
Byte 3: Data(7:0) (0x00-0xff)


Receiving
---------
Byte 0: Bits 31-28 contain the checksum to detect errors
        Bit 27 indicates if the last received packet was consistent (1) or inconsistent (0)
        Bit 26 is not used and is standard 1 (different firmware may mean standard 0)
        Bits 25-24 are error messages
            0x00: OK flag normal return status
            0x01: XE flag (execution error)
            0x02: AEA flag (automatic extended addressing)
            0x03: CP flag (command not complete, pending)
Byte 1: Register information
Byte 2: Data (15:8) (0x00-0xff)
Byte 3: Data (7:0) (0x00-0xff)


Automatic Extended Addressing (AEA)
-----------------------------------
A communication scheme that enables reading and writing messages 
    longer than 16 bits (e.g.) serial numbers
